## What I was trying to do  
I wanted to make this expermient singa and dance.

## The problem  
I kept getting a "We don't dance" feeling from Javascript.

## What I tried  
1. Watching "Footloose".  
2. Practicing with reels from "Dancing with the Stars".  
3. Put on my blue sued shoe code.
  

## What I learned  
- Javascript will only dance if you put it in the right format  
- Reading old code is a form of debugging  
- I need to slow down and name things clearly, one step at a time.  

## What I’ll try next  
- Rename variables consistently  
- Add console logs to trace the flow  
- Ask ChatGPT specific questions instead of general ones
